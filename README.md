https://github.com/SjoerdTilmans/sjvisualizer/assets/37220662/deae9c3c-8a90-4e64-a036-39fd636746a7
```python
from sjvisualizer import plot as plt

colors = {
    "United States": [
        23,
        60,
        154
    ],
	"Russia": [
        255,
        50,
        50
    ]
}

plt.line(excel="data/military budget.xlsx",
        title="Military Budget of Selected Countries",
        sub_title="in millions of US$",
        colors=colors)
```

### Animated Area Chart


https://github.com/SjoerdTilmans/sjvisualizer/assets/37220662/6304bb63-1076-4da8-b044-595f763d3546



```python
from sjvisualizer import plot as plt

colors = {
    "United States": [
        23,
        60,
        154
    ],
	"Russia": [
        255,
        50,
        50
    ]
}

plt.stacked_area(excel="data/Nuclear.xlsx",
        title="Nuclear Warheads by Country",
        colors=colors)
```
## Data format
Currently sjvisualizer reads data from an Excel file. The format should be as shown in the picture below:

In this file the first column should contain the dates, and each subsequent column holds the data for the data categories, in this example the different countries.

The date can either be shown as just the year, or as a full date as shown below. In this case, please make sure that Excel recognises the cell as a date.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! A couple of ideas to contribute:
- Improve documentation of this project. I have been thinking of setting up a readthedocs page.
- Add additional example scripts. If you do so, please includy any data files and image files so that the example is fully running
- Add new chart types. I have uploaded an example skeleton of new chart types in Empty.py, this is a setup that should serve as a good starting point. (https://github.com/SjoerdTilmans/sjvisualizer/blob/main/sjvisualizer/Empty.py)

Before making any changes, please create your own development branch here on GitHub. Once ready submit a pull request and set me as reviewer!
